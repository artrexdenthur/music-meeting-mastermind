Flatiron Learn-Co Software Engineering Module 03 Project: Ruby on Rails Application

This is a utility for musical organization, especially vocal "barbershop" style choruses. Users can create chorus objects and add non-user singers to them, and users can themselves choose other users' choruses to join.

This project is built in Ruby on Rails using Materialize theming, with handwritten JS on the frontend for the User page accessing the API.
